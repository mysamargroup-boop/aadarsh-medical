## Style Guidelines:

- Primary brand color: Deep Medical Blue (#0B3C5D), used for prominent text, navigation elements, and brand presence, conveying trust and professionalism. Its rich tone provides strong contrast in a light scheme.
- Accent colors: Teal Green (#0ABAB5) for interactive elements, highlights, and secondary calls to action, providing a vibrant, modern touch. Accent Sky Blue (#4DA8DA) is used for tertiary interactive elements and brighter visual accents.
- Backgrounds: Utilizes a sophisticated system of smooth gradients. The hero section features a transition from Deep Medical Blue to Teal Green to Soft Mint (#E6FFFA). Section backgrounds will vary between light mint and soft blue gradients, complementing the overall palette, avoiding plain white.
- Neutral color: Clean White (#FFFFFF) is used for card backgrounds and essential text contrast against darker elements. Soft Mint (#E6FFFA) acts as a very light, almost white background tone, especially in gradients.
- Headings and prominent text will use 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, geometric, and bold appearance. Body text and longer content will feature 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its excellent legibility and neutral, objective feel. 'Montserrat' (sans-serif) can be used for secondary headings or stylistic text elements. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- A suite of clean, line-art or subtly filled medical-themed icons (e.g., capsule outlines, plus symbol, ECG lines) will be integrated for category representation, 'Why Choose Us' highlights, and decorative, subtly animated background elements in the hero section.
- A responsive, modern corporate layout emphasizes gradient backgrounds over solid colors, soft shadows, and elegantly rounded corners. Section dividers will feature subtle wave or curved shapes. Mobile views will have adaptive designs including a smaller hero with a glassmorphism effect, a 2-column card grid for categories, and a sticky bottom navigation bar.
- Subtle and sophisticated animations will enhance user experience, including an autoplaying hero slider, faint floating medical background icons, soft glowing and slight scale hover effects on company logos and product cards, and smooth lift animations on category cards, ensuring a dynamic yet professional feel across the site.
